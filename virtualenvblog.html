                <h2> Setting up Virtual Environment for a Django Project </h2>
                <p class="blog-content">In this blog, we are going to see what is a virtual environment and it's
                    advantages, and how to set
                    it up in Ubuntu for
                    a Django project.
                </p>
                <h4>Virtual Environment:</h4>
                <p class="blog-content">
                    A virtual environment can have different versions of libraries, packages, and interpreters which are
                    isolated from other
                    virtual environments or global environment.A virtual environment is a directory tree which contains
                    Python executable files and other files which indicate that it
                    is a virtual environment.
                </p>
                <h4>Why Virtual Environment?</h4>
                <p class="blog-content">
                    By default, every project on our system will use these same directories to store and retrieve
                    packages (third party
                    libraries). Imagine a scenario where we have to develop two applications and we have Django 2.x and
                    Django3.x installed
                    globally. In such a case, it would be difficult for python to differentiate the packages as they are
                    residing under the
                    same directory. So we create a different environment for each project so that it won't consider
                    looking for any globally
                    installed packages as it checks only the packages that are installed in the virtual environment. In
                    this way, the dependencies will
                    be isolated from the
                    global (system) environment.
                </p>
                <h4>Steps for setting up Virtual Environment</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Installing virtualenv module
                        <p>We use a module called <b>virtualenv</b>. We can install it by the following command</p>
                        <p class="command ow">pip install virtualenv</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creating Virtual Environment
                        <p>When we create virtual environment it copies all python binary files from actual system
                            directory to current directory</p>
                        <p class="command ow">virtualenv env_name</p>
                        <p>* Here env_name is the environment name, you can choose any name</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Choosing python version to be used in virtual environment
                        <p>When we have more than one version of python installed on our machine then we can choose
                            which version to be used in virtual environment by the following command</p>
                        <p class="command ow">virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.8 env_name</p>
                        <p>In this case we have choosed python3.8</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Activating Virtual Environment
                        <p>To use the virtual environment that we just created we need to activate it by the following
                            command</p>
                        <p class="command ow">source env_name/bin/activate</p>
                        <p>Now this command will take us to our virtual environment</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Installing Required packages
                        <p>We use pip to install the required packages</p>
                        <p class="command ow">pip install django</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Checking installed packages
                        <p>In order to check the packages installed we can use the following command.</p>
                        <p class="command ow">pip freeze</p>
                        <p>This command will list all the packages that were installed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Exiting from virtual environment
                        <p>In order to exit from the virtual enviroment we can use the following command.</p>
                        <p class="command ow">deactivate</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
